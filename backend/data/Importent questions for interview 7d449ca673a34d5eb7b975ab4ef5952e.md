**Memory MAnagement in Java:**

Memory management in Java is handled automatically by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory for Java objects during program execution.

The JVM divides the memory into two parts: the heap and the stack. The heap is the memory area where objects are stored, while the stack is the memory area where method calls and local variables are stored.

When a new object is created, the JVM allocates memory for it on the heap. When the object is no longer needed, the JVM automatically deallocates the memory, freeing it up for other objects to use.

One important aspect of memory management in Java is garbage collection. Garbage collection is the process of automatically freeing up memory that is no longer being used by an object. The garbage collector runs periodically in the background, identifying objects that are no longer being referenced by any part of the program and freeing up their memory.

In addition to automatic memory management, Java provides a few mechanisms for developers to manage memory manually. For example, the System.gc() method can be called to request that the garbage collector run immediately, rather than waiting for its next scheduled run. The java.lang.Runtime class provides methods for querying and setting various JVM parameters, such as the size of the heap.

Overall, memory management in Java is designed to be simple and automatic, so that developers can focus on writing code rather than worrying about memory allocation and deallocation.

**Call by value  & Call by reference:**

**Call by value** means that the value of the argument is copied into a new variable and passed into the method. This means that any changes made to the parameter within the method do not affect the original value of the argument outside the method. Java uses call by value for primitive data types, such as int, boolean, and float.

**Call by reference** means that a reference to the original object is passed into the method. This means that any changes made to the parameter within the method affect the original object outside the method. Java uses call by reference for non-primitive data types, such as arrays, strings, and objects.

In summary, call by value means that a copy of the argument value is passed into the method, while call by reference means that a reference to the original object is passed into the method. Java uses call by value for primitive data types, and call by reference for non-primitive data types.

**Lambda Expression:**

Lambda expression basically express the instance of **Functional Interface.** 

An Interface with single abstract method is called **Functional Interface.**  An example is java.lang.Runnable.

**Tell about a time you did something innovative :**

During my time as a software engineer at my previous company, I was tasked with improving the performance of a **Java-based web application** that was experiencing some **slowdowns**. After conducting some research, I found that the bottleneck was in the **database layer**, where the application was **making multiple redundant queries to retrieve the same data**.

To address this issue, **I proposed a solution that involved implementing a caching mechanism that would store the frequently accessed data in memory**. I suggested using the **Java Caching System (JCS), which is a distributed, high-performance caching framework**, to implement this caching mechanism.

I worked with the development team to implement this solution, and we were able to significantly improve the performance of the application. The caching mechanism reduced the number of redundant database queries by caching frequently accessed data, resulting in faster response times and a more efficient use of system resources.

This solution was innovative in that it addressed a complex performance issue in a creative way, using a technology that was new to the team. It also demonstrated my ability to think critically and find efficient solutions to complex technical problems.

**Tell me about a time when you had a conflict with a co-worker.**

In my previous role as a software engineer, there was a time when I had a disagreement with one of my colleagues over the approach we should take to solving a particular technical challenge. My colleague and I both had strong opinions on the matter, and we couldn't seem to reach a common consensus on the best way forward.

To address the conflict, **I suggested that we schedule a meeting with our team lead to discuss the issue and come up with a resolution that worked for everyone.** During the meeting, we were able to share our perspectives and identify areas of common ground. We also thought about alternative solutions that covered our proposed approaches.

Ultimately, we were able to find a solution that satisfied both of us and allowed us to move forward with the project. Looking back on the experience, **I learned that conflict resolution requires active listening, a willingness to compromise, and the ability to find creative solutions that address everyone's concerns.** I've since made a conscious effort to cultivate these skills in all of my professional relationships.

**Text Based Adventures game:**

The objective of the game was for the player to navigate through a series of rooms, interacting with objects and battling enemies along the way. The game was designed to be text-based, with the player making choices by entering text commands.

To implement this game, I used several OOP concepts in Java, including inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. I created a Player class and an Enemy class, both of which were inherited from a Character superclass. This allowed me to define common attributes and behaviors for all characters in the game.

I also used encapsulation to protect the internal state of objects, such as health points and attack damage and provided public methods for interacting with those attributes. This helped to ensure the integrity of the game mechanics and prevented the player from accessing or modifying attributes in unintended ways.

Finally, I used polymorphism for different types of food by eating them players can get different health points. Each food was implemented as a subclass of the Food class and overrode methods to define its own behavior.

Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to apply OOP concepts in a practical way and develop my skills in Java programming. I learned a lot about the importance of designing flexible and maintainable code, as well as the benefits of using OOP principles to achieve those goals.

**What do you know about the Distributed Systems?**

Thank you for asking that question. Distributed systems are computer systems made up of multiple interconnected computers that work together to achieve a common goal. These systems are designed to improve performance, reliability, and scalability by distributing processing power and data across multiple nodes.

Distributed systems are used in a wide range of applications, including large-scale data processing, cloud computing, and distributed databases. Examples of distributed systems include Hadoop for distributed data processing, Apache Cassandra for distributed databases, and Kubernetes for container orchestration.

Designing and implementing distributed systems can be challenging due to issues such as network latency, consistency, fault tolerance, and security. To address these challenges, distributed systems often rely on algorithms and protocols such as the Paxos algorithm for consensus, the Raft protocol for replication, and the CAP theorem for trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.

Overall, distributed systems play an important role in modern computing, enabling large-scale processing, storage, and communication across a network of nodes. As a software developer, I understand the importance of designing and implementing distributed systems that are reliable, scalable, and secure, and I am excited about the challenges and opportunities that this field presents.

**how do you handle the conflict between different culture team members?**

Thank you for asking that question. While I haven't had the opportunity to work with individuals from different cultures in a professional setting, I believe that empathy and open-mindedness are essential in handling conflicts that may arise.

Firstly, it is important to acknowledge that cultural differences exist and that they can manifest in various ways, such as communication styles, attitudes towards authority, and decision-making processes. By recognizing and respecting these differences, I believe that team members can foster an environment of mutual understanding and appreciation.

Additionally, active listening and effective communication are crucial in handling conflicts that may arise between team members from different cultures. This involves taking the time to understand each person's perspective and working together to find common ground and solutions that are acceptable to all parties.

Finally, it may be beneficial to seek out training or resources on cultural competency to improve my understanding of different cultures and their practices. This can help to prevent misunderstandings and promote a culture of inclusivity and respect.
