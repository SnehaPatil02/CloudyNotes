# Bit bucket and Docker

**Bit bucket is a remote repository**

Bit bucket provides teams with one place to plan projects, collaborate on code, test and deploy.

Teams choose bit bucket because it has a superior jira integration, built-in CI and CD and is free for up to 5 users. 

We used bit bucket as a version control

**Docker**

Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build standardized, executable components that combines application source code with operating systems libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

**Jira**

We used JIRA as an issue tracker and we used to have stories assigned there by our seniors.

We used remote desktop which was VM ware.
