what is Version Control?

Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or a set of files over time so that you can recall specific version later. so ideally we can put any file in the computer on version control.

Why VCS?

VCS allows you to revert files back to the previous state, revert entire project back to previous state, review changes made over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when.

[You can evaluate changes made over time, check who last edited something that might be causing a problem, who initiated a problem, and when using VCS. You can even roll back entire projects or individual files.]

What is Git?

Git is a version control system for tracking changes to a computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. Git is a Distributed Version Control. So it does not necessarily rely on central server to store all the versions of the project files. Instead every user “clones” a copy of a repository (a collection of files) and has the full history of project on their own hard drive.

**Git helps you keep track of changes you made to your code. It is basically a history tab for your code.**

**Git also helps you *synchronise code* between multiple people.**

[Git is a version control system that allows several people to work on the same files while keeping track of changes made to them.Git is a Distributed Version Control.
Therefore, it is not required to store all project file versions on a single server.
Instead, each user "clones" a copy of a repository (a group of files) so that they each have a copy of the entire project's history on their hard drive.

You can trace the modifications you've made to your code with the help of Git.
It acts much like the history tab for your code.]

Git Workflow ➖

Repository :- is a collection of source code.

There are 4 fundamental elements in the git work flow :-

- Working directory
- Staging area
- Local repository(Head)
- Remote repository(Master)

    **Difference between git and gitflow** ➖
    
    **Git** is a free and open source distributed version control system 
    designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with 
    speed and efficiency. On the other hand, **Git Flow**
     is detailed as "*A set of git extensions to provide high-level repository operations*
    ". It provides excellent command line help and output. It is a merge based solution. It doesn't rebase feature branches.
    
    Gitflow is **an alternative Git branching model that involves the use of feature branches and multiple primary branches**
