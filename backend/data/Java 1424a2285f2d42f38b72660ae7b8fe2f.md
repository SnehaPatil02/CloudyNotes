### **1. Encapsulation (Data Hiding)**

**Definition:** Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit while restricting direct access to some details.

**Example in the Food Ordering System:**

- A **Customer** class encapsulates customer details like name, email, and phone number.
- These details should not be directly accessible from outside but through getter and setter methods.

✅ **Why Encapsulation?**

- Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive customer data.
- Allows controlled modification of data.

### **2. Inheritance (Code Reusability)**

**Definition:** Inheritance allows one class (child) to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class (parent).

**Example in the Food Ordering System:**

- A **User** class can be a parent class, and **Customer** and **RestaurantOwner** can be child classes inheriting common properties.

✅ **Why Inheritance?**

- Avoids code duplication.
- Common attributes and methods are reused.

### **3. Polymorphism (Method Overloading & Overriding)**

**Definition:** Polymorphism allows methods to take multiple forms. This can be achieved in two ways:

1. **Method Overloading** (Same method name but different parameters)
2. **Method Overriding** (Child class provides a specific implementation of a method)

### **Method Overloading Example (Compile-time Polymorphism)**

- A `Payment` class may have different methods to process payments via different modes.

### **Method Overriding Example (Runtime Polymorphism)**

- The `Restaurant` class has a `displayMenu()` method, but different types of restaurants may override it.

✅ **Why Polymorphism?**

- Increases flexibility by allowing different implementations of the same method.
- Helps in achieving **dynamic method dispatch** at runtime.

### **4. Abstraction (Hiding Implementation Details)**

**Definition:** Abstraction is the concept of hiding the implementation details and only showing essential features.

**Example in the Food Ordering System:**

- The `DeliveryService` class provides an abstract method `deliverOrder()`, but different delivery partners implement it in their own way.

✅ **Why Abstraction?**

- Hides complex logic from the user.
- Improves maintainability by separating implementation from definition.

### **Final Summary of OOPs Concepts in Food Ordering System**

| **OOP Concept** | **Real-world Example in Food Ordering System** |
| --- | --- |
| **Encapsulation** | Hiding customer details and providing controlled access through getters/setters. |
| **Inheritance** | `Customer` and `RestaurantOwner` inherit from `User` class. |
| **Polymorphism** | `displayMenu()` method behaves differently for Fast Food and Fine Dining restaurants. |
| **Abstraction** | `DeliveryService` defines `deliverOrder()` but different delivery types implement it uniquely. |

# Polymorphism

**Polymorphism** **is the ability of an object to take on many forms.** It allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions, with specific behaviors defined at runtime based on the actual object that is invoking the method. Polymorphism is mainly divided into two types in Java:

- **Compile-time (Static) Polymorphism**: This is achieved through **method overloading**, where the method that gets invoked is determined at compile-time.
- **Runtime (Dynamic) Polymorphism**: This is achieved through **method overriding**, where the method that gets invoked is determined at runtime based on the actual object type, even though the reference may be of a superclass type.

The process of representing one form in multiple forms is known as **Polymorphism**.

**Different definitions of Polymorphism are:**

1. Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
2. Polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations
3. We can create functions or reference variables that behave differently in a different programmatic context.
4. Polymorphism means many forms.

## A real-world example of polymorphism

Suppose if you are in a classroom at that time you behave like a **student**, when you are in the market at that time you behave like a **customer** when you at your home at that time you behave like a **son** or **daughter**, Here one person present in different-different behaviors.

### Differences Between Polymorphism, Overloading, and Overriding:

| Feature | **Polymorphism** | **Overloading** | **Overriding** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Type** | Can be Compile-time (static) or Runtime (dynamic) | Compile-time (static polymorphism) | Runtime (dynamic polymorphism) |
| **Definition** | The ability of an object to take many forms | Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters | Subclass provides its own implementation of a superclass method |
| **Binding** | Both compile-time (overloading) and runtime (overriding) | Compile-time | Runtime |
| **Method Signature** | Not necessarily related to method signature | Same method name, different parameter list | Same method name and parameter list |
| **Inheritance Requirement** | Required for runtime polymorphism (overriding) | Not required | Required |
| **Return Type** | Can vary in compile-time polymorphism | Can vary (not necessarily the same) | Must be the same or a covariant return type |
| **Object Type vs. Reference Type** | Polymorphism depends on the actual object at runtime | Not relevant (resolved at compile-time) | Depends on the actual object at runtime |
| **Usage Example** | Overriding methods to allow different behavior for different object types | Overloading constructors or utility methods for flexibility | Providing specific behavior in subclasses for inherited methods |

**Comparable v/s Comparator :**

In Java, `Comparator` and `Comparable` are two interfaces used for sorting collections and arrays of objects. They serve similar purposes but are used in different contexts and have different functionalities. Here’s a detailed explanation of their differences:

### Comparable Interface

1. **Definition**: The `Comparable` interface is used to define the natural ordering of objects of a class. A class that implements `Comparable` must define the `compareTo` method.
2. **Single Sorting Sequence**: Implementing `Comparable` allows for only one way of sorting. The class itself determines how its instances are compared.
3. **Implementation**:
    - The class that needs to be compared must implement the `Comparable` interface.
    - The `compareTo` method is overridden to define the natural ordering.
    - The `compareTo` method returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer if the object is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified object, respectively.
4. **Example**:
    
    ```java
    javaCopy code
    public class Student implements Comparable<Student> {
        private String name;
        private int age;
    
        public Student(String name, int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }
    
        @Override
        public int compareTo(Student other) {
            return Integer.compare(this.age, other.age); // Natural ordering by age
        }
    
        // Getters and toString() method
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
        students.add(new Student("Alice", 22));
        students.add(new Student("Bob", 20));
        students.add(new Student("Charlie", 21));
    
        Collections.sort(students); // Sorts using compareTo method
        for (Student s : students) {
            System.out.println(s);
        }
    }
    
    ```
    

### Comparator Interface

1. **Definition**: The `Comparator` interface is used to define multiple ways of comparing two objects of a class. It is typically used when you want to sort objects in ways that differ from their natural ordering.
2. **Multiple Sorting Sequences**: Using `Comparator` allows for multiple ways of sorting. You can create different comparators for different sorting sequences.
3. **Implementation**:
    - A separate class or an anonymous class implements the `Comparator` interface.
    - The `compare` method is overridden to define the custom ordering.
    - The `compare` method returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer if the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second, respectively.
4. **Example**:
    
    ```java
    javaCopy code
    public class Student {
        private String name;
        private int age;
    
        public Student(String name, int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }
    
        // Getters and toString() method
    }
    
    public class AgeComparator implements Comparator<Student> {
        @Override
        public int compare(Student s1, Student s2) {
            return Integer.compare(s1.getAge(), s2.getAge());
        }
    }
    
    public class NameComparator implements Comparator<Student> {
        @Override
        public int compare(Student s1, Student s2) {
            return s1.getName().compareTo(s2.getName());
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
        students.add(new Student("Alice", 22));
        students.add(new Student("Bob", 20));
        students.add(new Student("Charlie", 21));
    
        Collections.sort(students, new AgeComparator()); // Sorts by age
        for (Student s : students) {
            System.out.println(s);
        }
    
        Collections.sort(students, new NameComparator()); // Sorts by name
        for (Student s : students) {
            System.out.println(s);
        }
    }
    
    ```
    

### Key Differences

- **Purpose**:
    - `Comparable`: Used to define the natural ordering of objects. A class implements `Comparable` to specify how its instances are compared.
    - `Comparator`: Used to define multiple custom orderings. A separate class or an anonymous class implements `Comparator` to compare objects in different ways.
- **Method**:
    - `Comparable`: Implements the `compareTo` method.
    - `Comparator`: Implements the `compare` method.
- **Flexibility**:
    - `Comparable`: Provides a single default sorting behavior.
    - `Comparator`: Allows for multiple sorting behaviors and can be changed without modifying the class itself.
- **Usage**:
    - `Comparable`: When you have one natural way of comparing objects.
    - `Comparator`: When you need multiple ways of comparing objects or when you cannot modify the class to implement `Comparable`.

1. **When to Use Abstract Classes**:
    - Use an abstract class when you want to provide a base class with some common functionality, but also want to enforce that certain methods must be implemented by subclasses.
    - Abstract classes are useful when multiple related classes share common behavior, but you want to ensure that each subclass defines its own specific behaviors.

### Real-World Use of Interfaces:

1. **Multiple Inheritance of Behavior**: Java does not allow multiple inheritance of classes, but a class can implement multiple interfaces, effectively allowing a form of multiple inheritance of behavior.
2. **Defining Contracts for Behavior**: Interfaces define a **contract** for what a class must do, without specifying how it should do it. This promotes a clean separation between what a class does and how it does it, enabling more flexible and modular code.
3. **Loose Coupling**: Interfaces allow for **loose coupling** between components. When you program to an interface, you can change the underlying implementation without affecting the code that uses the interface. This is particularly useful in large-scale systems where you may need to swap out different implementations based on requirements or performance considerations.

### Differences Between Abstract Classes and Interfaces:

1. **Abstract Classes**:
    - Can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods.
    - Can have constructors, fields, and method implementations.
    - A class can only extend one abstract class (single inheritance).
2. **Interfaces** (after Java 8):
    - Can contain abstract methods, default methods, and static methods.
    - Cannot have instance fields or constructors.
    - A class can implement multiple interfaces (multiple inheritance of behavior).

### Key Differences Between Interface and Abstract Class:

| **Feature** | **Interface** | **Abstract Class** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Method Implementation** | Can have abstract methods, default methods, static methods (since Java 8). | Can have both abstract and concrete methods. |
| **Multiple Inheritance** | A class can implement multiple interfaces. | A class can extend only one abstract class (single inheritance). |
| **Fields** | Can only have `public`, `static`, and `final`constants (no instance fields). | Can have instance variables and constants (fields can be `protected`, `private`, etc.). |
| **Constructors** | Cannot have constructors. | Can have constructors, but cannot instantiate directly. |
| **Use Case** | Used to define a contract for behavior that multiple unrelated classes can implement. | Used when related classes share common behavior but also need to define their own methods. |

**Can we make a class abstract without an abstract method?**

Yes, in Java, you can make a class **abstract** without having any abstract methods. A class can be declared abstract simply by using the `abstract` keyword, even if it does not contain any abstract methods. The primary purpose of making a class abstract is to prevent it from being instantiated directly, even if it contains fully implemented methods.

**Can we make a class both final and abstract at the same time?**

No, you **cannot** make a class both `final` and `abstract` at the same time in Java. These two keywords are contradictory and serve opposite purposes:

- The `*abstract**` keyword indicates that a class is meant to be **inherited** and cannot be instantiated directly. Abstract classes are designed to be **extended** by subclasses.
- The `*final**` keyword, when applied to a class, means that the class **cannot be extended** or inherited by any subclass. This is typically used to prevent further modification or extension of the class.

**Can we overload or override the main method in Java?**

**Overloading the `main` Method:**

Yes, you **can overload** the `main` method in Java. Overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists (number or types of parameters). The **JVM** will always look for the specific `main` method signature when starting a program.

However, you can define additional `main` methods with different signatures in the same class, but they won't be used as the entry point for the application. The overloaded `main` methods can be invoked like any other method within your code.

### Overriding the `main` Method:

No, you **cannot override** the `main` method in Java in the traditional sense of method overriding because `main` is a **static method**. In Java, static methods are associated with the class, not with instances of the class. Since overriding requires dynamic method dispatch (which occurs based on the instance of the class), static methods cannot be overridden. Overriding applies to instance methods only.

However, you can define a `main` method in a subclass, but this will result in **method hiding** rather than overriding. The subclass will hide the `main` method of its superclass, and the version of `main` that gets called depends on the class that is being referenced at compile time.

**Can an interface extend more than one interface in Java?**

Yes, in Java, an interface can extend more than one interface. This is one of the key features of interfaces in Java that supports **multiple inheritance of behavior**. When an interface extends multiple interfaces, it inherits the abstract methods and default methods from all the interfaces it extends. This allows a single interface to combine the behaviors defined in several other interfaces.

**Can a class extend more than one class in Java?**

No, a class in Java **cannot extend more than one class**. Java does not support **multiple inheritance** for classes, meaning a class can only extend one superclass. This is to avoid complexities and potential ambiguities that arise from multiple inheritance, such as the **Diamond Problem**.

**What is the difference between abstraction and polymorphism in Java?**

### **Difference Between Abstraction and Polymorphism in Java:**

| Feature | **Abstraction** | **Polymorphism** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Definition** | Hiding the implementation details and exposing only the essential features. | Ability of an object to take many forms and methods to behave differently based on the object invoking them. |
| **Purpose** | Define the structure of an object and focus on what an object can do without worrying about how it does it. | Allow one action to be performed in different ways, depending on the object or method signature. |
| **How Achieved** | Achieved using **abstract classes** or **interfaces**. | Achieved through **method overloading** (compile-time) and **method overriding** (runtime). |
| **Example of Use** | Exposing a blueprint (such as vehicle behaviors) for multiple subclasses. | Providing different behaviors (e.g., animal sounds) based on the actual object type. |
| **Compile-time vs Runtime** | Primarily related to design-time (compile-time) as it focuses on hiding internal details. | Can be either **compile-time** (overloading) or **runtime**(overriding) polymorphism. |
| **Flexibility** | Defines what must be done but allows implementing classes to vary the details. | Allows for different implementations of the same method in different classes, providing runtime flexibility. |
| **Type** | A design principle related to hiding complexity. | A behavior concept that allows methods or operations to perform differently in different contexts. |
| **Example** | Abstract method `start()` defined in `Vehicle`, implemented by `Car` and `Bike`. | Method `sound()` overridden in `Dog` and `Cat` to provide specific behavior. |
