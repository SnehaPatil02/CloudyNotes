# Spring Boot

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based application that you can “Just Run”

**Spring Boot Layers**

The spring boot consists of the following four layers:

1. **Presentation Layer** – Authentication & Json Translation
2. **Business Layer** – Business Logic, Validation & Authorization
3. **Persistence Layer** – Storage Logic
4. **Database Layer** – Actual Database

Fig 1 – Layers Of Spring Boot

**1. Presentation Layer**

The presentation layer is the top layer of the spring boot 
architecture. It consists of Views. i.e., the front-end part of the 
application. It handles the HTTP requests and performs authentication. 
It is responsible for converting the JSON field’s parameter to Java 
Objects and vice-versa. Once it performs the authentication of the 
request it passes it to the next layer. i.e., the business layer.

**2. Business Layer**

The business layer contains all the business logic. It consists of 
services classes. It is responsible for validation and authorization.

**3. Persistence Layer**

The persistence layer contains all the database storage logic. It is 
responsible for converting business objects to the database row and 
vice-versa.

**4. Database Layer**

The database layer contains all the databases such as [MySql](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-tutorial/), [MongoDB](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mongodb-an-introduction/), etc. This layer can contain multiple databases. It is responsible for performing the [CRUD](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/spring-boot-crud-operations/) operations.

### Spring Boot Flow Architecture

**Explanation:**

- The Client makes an **HTTP** request(GET, PUT, POST, etc.)
- The HTTP request is forwarded to the **Controller**. The controller maps the request. It processes the handles and calls the server logic.
- The business logic is performed in the **Service layer**. The spring boot performs all the logic over the data of the database which is mapped to the spring boot model class through [Java Persistence Library](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/spring-boot-spring-data-jpa/)(**JPA**).
- The [JSP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-jsp/) page is returned as Response from the controller.

**Bean :-**

In the context of the Spring Framework, a "bean" is a fundamental building block and a key concept. Beans are Java objects that are managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. They are created, configured, and managed by the container and can be of various types, such as Java objects, JavaBeans, or POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects).

Here are some key characteristics and concepts related to beans in Spring:

1. **Bean Definition:** A bean is defined in the Spring configuration as a class or a set of instructions that the IoC container uses to create and configure an object. Bean definitions typically include information about the class to be instantiated, the dependencies it has, and other configuration settings.
2. **Lifecycle Management:** Spring manages the complete lifecycle of beans, including creating, initializing, using, and eventually destroying them when they are no longer needed. Beans can have callback methods like `init()` and `destroy()` for custom initialization and destruction logic.
3. **Dependency Injection:** Beans often have dependencies on other beans, and Spring performs dependency injection to inject these dependencies into a bean. This allows you to achieve loose coupling and modularization in your application.
4. **Scope:** Beans can have different scopes, defining how long a bean's instance should live and when it should be created and destroyed. Common scopes include Singleton (one instance per container), Prototype (a new instance per request), Request (one instance per HTTP request), and Session (one instance per HTTP session).
5. **Configuration:** Beans can be defined in Spring configuration files using XML, Java configuration (with `@Configuration` and `@Bean` annotations), or through component scanning and annotations, such as `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller`.
6. **Inversion of Control (IoC):** The Spring container manages the creation and wiring of beans, inverting the control of object creation from your application code to the Spring container. This promotes decoupling, easier testing, and flexibility.
7. **AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming):** Spring allows you to apply aspect-oriented programming concepts through features like AspectJ, enabling cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security) to be applied to beans in a modular way.
8. **Annotation-Driven Development:** Spring supports the use of annotations to simplify bean configuration and component scanning. Annotations like `@Component`, `@Autowired`, and `@Value` reduce the need for XML configuration.

The scope of a bean determines its lifecycle and how many instances are created. Common bean scopes include:

- **Singleton:** Only one instance of the bean is created and shared within the container. This is the default scope.
- **Prototype:** A new instance is created each time the bean is requested.
- **Request:** A new instance is created for each HTTP request in a web application. This scope is used for web-specific beans.
- **Session:** A new instance is created for each HTTP session in a web application.
- **Custom Scopes:** You can define custom bean scopes to meet specific requirements.

The choice of scope depends on the use case. Singleton is suitable for stateless and shared services, while prototype is appropriate for stateful, non-shared objects. Request and session scopes are used in web applications to manage objects across HTTP requests and sessions.

In summary, in Spring, a bean is a managed Java object that is created and configured by the Spring IoC container. Beans are a fundamental concept in the framework, and understanding their lifecycle, configuration, and scope is essential for building Spring-based applications.

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a fundamental concept in the Spring Framework and many other Inversion of Control (IoC) containers. It's a design pattern that enables you to achieve loose coupling between components in your application by externalizing the configuration and management of their dependencies.

In the context of Spring, Dependency Injection refers to the process of providing the dependencies (e.g., other objects or services) that a class (typically a bean) requires, rather than having the class create or manage those dependencies itself. Instead of tightly coupling classes together by directly instantiating or looking up their dependencies, Spring takes on the responsibility of wiring the components together.

There are several benefits to using Dependency Injection in Spring:

1. **Reduced Coupling:** DI promotes loose coupling between classes, making your code more modular and maintainable. Classes don't need to know the concrete details of their dependencies.
2. **Increased Testability:** With dependencies injected, it's easier to substitute real implementations with mock or test-specific implementations during unit testing, making it easier to write and maintain tests.
3. **Configurability:** Dependency injection allows you to configure the wiring between components externally, typically through XML configuration files, Java annotations, or Java-based configuration. This means you can change the behavior of your application without modifying its source code.
4. **Reusability:** Components that rely on dependencies are more reusable because they don't have hardcoded references to specific implementations.

In Spring, Dependency Injection is typically implemented in the following ways:

1. **Constructor Injection:** Dependencies are provided through the constructor of the class. This is the most common and recommended form of DI in Spring.
    
    ```
    
    public class MyService { private final Dependency dependency; public MyService(Dependency dependency) { this.dependency = dependency; } // ...
    }
    
    ```
    
- **Setter Injection:** Dependencies are set using setter methods. This is useful when you have optional dependencies.
- **Field Injection:** Dependencies are injected directly into fields using annotations.
    
    ```
    @Autowired
    private Dependency dependency;
    
    ```
    

Spring provides several ways to configure and manage the injection of dependencies, including XML configuration, Java-based configuration, and annotation-based configuration. You can use annotations like `@Autowired`, `@Qualifier`, and `@Resource` to specify dependencies and perform injection.

Here's an example of how you might configure dependency injection using XML in a Spring configuration file:

```
xml

```

```xml
<bean id="myService" class="com.example.MyService">
    <property name="dependency" ref="myDependency"/>
</bean>

<bean id="myDependency" class="com.example.MyDependency"/>

```

In this example, `myService` depends on `myDependency`, and the Spring container will take care of injecting `myDependency` into `myService` when the application context is created.

Dependency Injection is a core concept in the Spring Framework and plays a crucial role in making Spring applications modular, testable, and easy to configure. It promotes best practices in software design, such as separation of concerns and the single responsibility principle.

**Spring Boot** and **Spring MVC** are both part of the broader Spring Framework ecosystem, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Let's explore the differences between Spring Boot and Spring MVC:

**Spring MVC:**

1. **Purpose:**
    - **Spring MVC** (Model-View-Controller) is a web application framework within the Spring Framework. It is primarily used for building web applications, including RESTful web services.
    - Spring MVC focuses on providing a structured framework for building web applications, defining controllers, views, and handling HTTP requests and responses.
2. **Configuration:**
    - Spring MVC applications typically require extensive configuration, which often involves setting up XML or Java-based configuration for components like controllers, views, and data sources.
    - Developers are responsible for configuring various aspects of the application, such as dispatcher servlets and view resolvers.
3. **Development Approach:**
    - Spring MVC follows a traditional, manual configuration approach, allowing developers to have fine-grained control over the application's setup.
    - You need to explicitly configure beans, routes, and other components based on your application's requirements.
4. **Integration:**
    - Spring MVC can be used with various technologies and frameworks, but it requires manual integration and configuration.
    - Developers need to set up and configure dependencies for features like security, data access, and aspect-oriented programming.

**Spring Boot:**

1. **Purpose:**
    - **Spring Boot** is an opinionated framework for building stand-alone, production-ready applications. It simplifies the setup, configuration, and development of Spring applications.
    - Spring Boot is not limited to web applications; it can be used for a wide range of applications, including web, microservices, and batch processing.
2. **Configuration:**
    - Spring Boot emphasizes convention over configuration. It provides sensible defaults and auto-configuration that can be customized if needed.
    - The framework minimizes the need for extensive manual configuration, reducing the burden on developers.
3. **Development Approach:**
    - Spring Boot encourages rapid application development with a minimum of boilerplate code. Developers can focus on writing business logic rather than extensive configuration.
    - The framework promotes the use of annotations and sensible defaults for many aspects of application development.
4. **Integration:**
    - Spring Boot simplifies integration with various technologies and frameworks by providing a wide range of "starters." Starters are pre-configured templates for building specific types of applications, such as web applications, data processing applications, and more.
    - It includes pre-configured auto-configuration options for aspects like security, data access, and logging, which can be customized as needed.

In summary, the primary difference between Spring Boot and Spring MVC lies in their focus and approach to application development. Spring MVC is a web framework within the Spring ecosystem that provides extensive control and configuration options for building web applications. Spring Boot, on the other hand, is an opinionated framework designed to streamline the development of a variety of applications, providing sensible defaults and reducing the need for manual configuration. Spring Boot is often used for quickly creating stand-alone, production-ready applications, including web applications, microservices, and more.

**RESTful web services**, often referred to simply as **REST**
 (Representational State Transfer), are a type of architectural style 
for designing networked applications. They are based on a set of 
principles and constraints that provide a scalable and stateless 
communication mechanism for distributed systems. RESTful web services 
use HTTP as the communication protocol and are widely used for building 
web APIs.
